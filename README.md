# JavaScript Calculator

A simple calculator built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that performs basic arithmetic operations and handles user input dynamically.

## ðŸ”¹ Features

- Supports addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`Ã—`), and division (`Ã·`)
- Handles multi-digit numbers, decimals, and negative values
- Allows chained operations (e.g. `3 + 4 Ã—` auto-calculates `3 + 4` first)
- Functional `Clear`, `Delete`, and `Equals` buttons
- Real-time screen updates

## Core Concepts Applied

- **DOM manipulation** with `querySelector` and `addEventListener`
- **Array-based expression tracking** using `currentEquation`
- **Input validation** for edge cases (e.g. double operators, divide by 0)
- **String-based number handling** for smooth deletion of decimals/negatives
- **Function decomposition** for cleaner logic and reusability
